Welcome to xofz.Core!  Here you will find something called a Materialized Enumerable.  What I mean by a materialized enumerable is that it has been written to memory and therefore may be iterated as many times as we want.  It also gets a Count property.

After you understand what I mean by materialized enumerable, check out the types in the Transformation\ folder!  If they don't make sense, for some of them you can see an example application built around them in the Apps\ folder.

My personal favorite in Transformation is the EnumerableRotator :)
