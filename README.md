Welcome to xofz.Core!  Here you will find something called a Materialized Enumerable.  What I mean by a materialized enumerable is that it has been written to memory and therefore may be iterated as many times as we want.  It also gets a Count property.

After you understand what I mean by materialized enumerable, check out the types in the Framework\Transformation\ folder!  My personal favorite in Transformation is the EnumerableRotator :)

There is also ample base presentation logic contained here to set up a fat client.  It revolves around the use of Passive View.
